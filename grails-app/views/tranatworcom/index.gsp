People migrating between the U.S. and Mexico and Guatemala belong to 
transnational communities - they retain ties to their communities of 
origin, and establish new communities in new areas as they migrate in 
search of work.  Those ties are often so strong, and the movement of 
people back and forth is so great, that in some sense people belong to a
 single community which exists in different locations, on both sides of 
the border.
</p><br/>

<p class="twc">
This project looks at the lives of people, the ties that bind them 
together, their relation to work and the pursuit of work, the nature and
 scope of their poverty, and how they struggle for a better life, both 
individually and as a community.  It looks at migrants from Mexican, 
Guatemalan and U.S. perspectives, through first-hand accounts of people 
themselves.
</p><br/>

<p class="twc">
Poverty in the U.S. is intimately connected with poverty in Mexico and 
other countries of the developing world.  People have to maintain more 
than one household, supporting communities of origin with remittances 
earned from work in the U.S.  The work available to migrants is often 
very low-paid and the working conditions dangerous and unhealthy.  This 
creates an economic impact on communities of immigrant workers in the 
U.S., and affects their stability.  While the income of migrants in the 
U.S. is often many times what is possible for families in communities of
 origin, working communities of migrants still have survival problems 
because of the relation between their income and what it costs to 
survive in the U.S.
</p><br/>

<p class="twc">
But while often economically poor, migrant communities are rich in 
cultural and organizational traditions which help them to survive and 
work for a better life.  Immigrants from the same town often belong to 
soccer teams, in a larger league which groups together teams from 
different towns and states.  Indigenous workers speaking Mixtec, Zapotec
 or Triqui set up organizations to defend their interests, like the 
Mixtec Binational Front.  Family networks running from Puebla to Reynosa
 to Los Angeles to Omaha to Madison help family members immigrate from 
home communities, and provide support when people arrive.  Those same 
networks often provide a support framework for mutual aid societies 
during periods of labor conflict.
</p><br/>

<p class="twc">
These networks are creating a culture with its own songs, food, slang 
expressions in language, and other manifestations.  This culture has an 
impact on the larger communities and organizations in the U.S. of which 
immigrants become a part.  The impact of immigrant workers sparks 
everything from a renaissance marimba music and an open, inclusive style
 of union organizing.
</p><br/>

<p class="twc">
By documenting this process in photographs and interviews, we can 
understand this experience better, through the eyes and voice of those 
for whom it is a living reality.
