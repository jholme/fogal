</span></p>

<p>
DB:  Where are you from?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Antonio Rivera Murrieta.  I
 was born on February 19th at a very beautiful place in the state of 
Sonora- in Trincheras, on the land of Joaquin Murrieta.  I calle it 
Joaquin Murrieta's land because that's what my great grandfather told me
 and he was Murrieta's cousin.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  What did they say to you in your youth about Joaquin Murrieta?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They spoke about him as the one who 
went to California at the time to guide the others from Sonora, to mine 
gold there.  There used to be 10,300 people living in California who 
were from Sonora back then.  After they returned to Mexico, they were 
afraid because of the persecution against Murrieta, and they didn't 
speak much about him.  That was very true of my grandfather, although 
not my great grandfather.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They feared that the people who persecuted
 Murrieta would follow them all the way to Trincheras.  In addition, 
people from our family, the Murrietas, couldn't come to the United 
States - it was taboo.  Many would be denied entry, many were denied a 
passport and others were denied entrance.  One of them was Juan 
Murrieta- brother of the president of the association of Murrieta's 
descendants in Trincheras.  It took the US government more than 3 years 
to give me a visa because they'd ask me if I was in the Communist Party,
 or if I was an activist against the Mexican government.  They made a 
lot of excuses, but I knew what the problem was.  It was that I had the 
last name of Murrieta.  The name bothered them.  So it took 3 years.  I 
had an appointment every 6 months and finally after 3 years they gave me
 my passport in Sonoita, Sonora.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  What happened with Juan Murrieta?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan Murrieta was passing through 
Nogales and they said they asked him, "are you related to Joaquin 
Murrieta?"  When he answered that he was, they told him that he no 
longer had a passport, and they ripped it up.  This happened in 1946 
-47.
</p>

<p>
DB:  So almost 100 years after Joaquin Murrieta died, they still feared him?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still had that fear because the 
textbooks in the primary schools in Arizona and California  said he was a
 "gringo eater," that he killed one for breakfast, one for lunch and 
another for dinner.  They said he killed people in knife fights, and 
called him a bandit, an assailant.  But we all know that Joaquin 
Murrieta was a social fighter.  He wanted to retrieve the part of Mexico
 that was lost at that time in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
</p>

<p>
DB:  When I was a child I read the kinds of things you're talking about 
in the schools I attended in California.  What was the real story of 
Joaquin Murrieta?  Where was he from and what did he do?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true story is that the people from
 Sonora living in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas - the Mexicans 
here - were the last ones to realize that the land wasn't part of Mexico
 any more, and that they were no longer Mexicans.  There wasn't mail in 
those days, or anything that could have told them that this happened.  
They started to realize it when Anglos came and wanted to take away 
their mines, their farms, their cattle, their way of living and the 
little they had.  In addition, they were assaulted in Yuma.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many Joaquin Murrietas.  
Many Mexicans were angry during that time and fought, but Joaquin 
Murrieta lasted the longest because he had more luck and was more 
organized.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to recover that part of 
Mexico that was ours.  There is talk that he had contact with the 
Mexican federal government back then, but the federal government didn't 
support his effort to recover that lost part of Mexico.  So the only 
thing left for him was to defend himself and the rights of the Mexicans -
 the people from Sonora who were still living there.

Trincheras, Sonora  12/4/02<br>
Alberto Murrieta, 92 years old, is the oldest living descendent of 
Joaquin Murrieta.  He lives by himself on a ranch outside Trincheras.
</span>
</div>
</p>

<p>
DB:  Who were these people?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were country people.  They were 
the ones who showed the Anglos how to mine the gold, to extract the gold
 from the earth.  Up until then, in the United States there weren't many
 gold mines, only one in North Carolina.  So the Anglos who arrived in 
California didn't know how to mine the gold.  It was the people from 
Sonora who showed them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what we want to explain, so 
that North Americans understand the fundamental value that Mexicans made
 to the development of California and what it is today.  That's the 
point.   The gold fever was the foundation that made California, and 
people from Sonora had the principal role in teaching the Anglos how to 
mine the gold.  Joaquin Murrieta was not a bandit.  He was not a killer 
of North Americans.  He was a social fighter, and that's why Mexicans 
called him a patriot.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  And now, 150 years later, why is Joaquin Murrieta's life still something important or relevant?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like North Americans to better
 understand us, the Mexicans - the fundamental value that we have - 
because we still come to work here.  We come to develop this country.  
They, of course, pay us, thank God, but we are a very important part of 
this country.  Chicanos and Mexicans still come to work in industry, the
 restaurants, the cleaning, in the warehouses, and the fields.  Without 
Mexicans, the crops wouldn't be harvested, because, lets be honest, the 
majority of the North Americans don't want to work as farmworkers 
because it's hard work.  We do.  Why?  Possibly because we're already 
used to hard work.  That's what we want them to learn.  And we need to 
learn more about North Americans as well.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  When did you get interested in social movements, and when did it become part of your own life?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began to participate in forming the 
social movement of the International Association of the Descendents of 
Joaquin Murrieta in 1987.  Before that, we would had conversations with 
Alfredo Figueroa in Blythe, California, who is the president of the 
association.  But in 1988, we started to openly fight to clear Joaquin 
Murrieta's name, and for these ideas of social justice.  We fight for 
our people here that can't get a drivers license, and whose car 
insurance costs them triple that of a resident or a North American.  
Just because someone is an illegal, it doesn't mean that he doesn't know
 how to drive.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  So the Association of the Descendents of Joaquin Murrieta is part 
of a broader movement for the civil rights of the undocumented here?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want mutual understanding between 
the North Americans and the Mexicans of who Murrieta was, to dissipate 
from the minds of children and adults of that Murrieta was a "gringo 
killer" - that he was bandit, a pistolero, that he stole and murdered.  
We want people to understand that he fought to recover part of his 
fatherland and that he defended the Mexicans of that time.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To us, that's part of a better 
understanding between North Americans and Mexicans that since we're 
here, we have to fight for the undocumented as well , against the abuse 
they suffer.  We have more than 3 million undocumented right now in the 
United States and we have no way to document them.  We want an agreement
 that these people have rights, that they get paid better, that they can
 get a green card, a driver's license, car insurance, and a house to 
live in.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we started, we've helped the 
clinic in Trincheras, where Joaquin Murrieta lived.  We have taken them 
medication and medical instruments, and an ambulance.  We are in the 
process of getting them a school bus and a few other things: clothes, 
typewriters.  We have two complete computers with printers for the high 
school in Trincheras.  We still don't have the 23 kilometers that are 
needed of asphalt, to pave the primary road to the state highway.

<p>
DB:  Hector Moroyoqui, the high school teacher in Trincheras, says 
cultural activities are needed to encourage more respect toward the 
indigenous heritage of the people that live there, from the Mayos, the 
Yaquis, the Papagos, and other indigenous groups.  Is the Murieta 
Assoiciation also supporting this effort?  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we have always been in contact 
with the indigenous groups.  The governor of the Papagos, Rafael 
Garcia-Valencia is a consultant to us.  He is an assistant to the mayor 
of Caborca, and is a teacher in Quitovac, near Sonoita, an indigenous 
Papago community.  Because of the current change in the political party 
of the president of the republic, we feel that indigenous people have 
more support.  So we're going to take advantage of that opportunity for 
us to ask more from the government.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The municipal president of Trincheras 
is of Mayo origin, from Navojoa.  He helped us get into contact with the
 Mayo, and for the first time, three and a half years ago, we were able 
to bring a strong group of the Mayo to dance at our fiesta.  A Yaqui 
group also came from Ciudad Obregon.

<br>
<p>
DB:  So the association has two areas of emphasis, one to establish this
 dialog between the Mexicans and North Americans to have more respect 
towards the Mexicans and also to have more recognition of the indigenous
 heritage of the people in Sonora in the area of Trincheras and Caborca?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that's it.  We are doing both 
things - supporting the indigenous people, the Mexican Indians: the 
Otum, the Guarillios, the Papago, the Mayo, the Yaqui, the Cucapaz, the 
Mujavi, the Chimahuevo, because those are the people of Murrieta.  Back 
then, Joaquin Murrieta was guided by them.  He wasn't born familiar with
 the trails where they walked from Trincheras to California.  That was a
 6 month trip.  He was guided by the Papagos, in the Trincheras region 
of Caborca.  The Papagos and the Pimas and the Opotas, were the ones who
 guided Murrieta all the way to California.  The authentic paths are 
still there - the "Devil's Path," where Murrieta passed.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty years ago, on a mountain near 
Caborca, I saw a rock with Joaquin Murrieta's name on it, that says 1850
 with a arrow next to it, next to the Devil's Path.  But we have not 
been able to find that rock again.  It disappeared as though through an 
act of magic.  We are still looking for it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Murrieta himself also had 
indigenous blood because his last name was Orozco from his mother's 
side, and that name is associated with the Otum and Pima.  Even more, he
 could have Mayo blood, because the original Murrietas, Joaquin's 
parents and uncles, came from Alamo, Sonora.  Alamo was the Mayos' 
fundamental area then.  So I think that the principal blood that we, the
 Murrietas have, is Mayo blood.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  Many things remaining from that era are disappearing.  I saw and 
photographed some of the iron crosses on the graves in the cemetery in 
La Cienega, that were made in the time of Murrieta, but many of them 
have now disappeared.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.  La Cienega is the place where 
Joaquin Murrieta had his ranch, where he kept almost 2,000 horses.  It 
was called La Verruga.  That's where he stored the horses, weapons, and 
ammunition he planned to use to take the part of Mexico back that was 
taken from us, supposedly sold by Antonio Lopez Santana after the war in
 Texas.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  What happened in your own life that made you want to get involved in the association?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I have always been social 
fighter.  I participated in politics in Mexico for many years, first in 
the PRI, the governing party that has just been voted out of power.  I 
participated there for 16 years, from the time I was 16 years old.  I 
was the President of the PRI in Caborca, and the Secretary of the 
Municipial President.  I was the secretary for civic participation in 
Benjamin Hill in Sonora.  After, I began fighting against the 
government, and I became active in the National Action Party.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government did not want to accept 
change, to support social struggles.   All of the government bodies that
 were able to get power only used it to fill their pockets, while the 
town they were governing was marginalized.  Apparently, they'd do work. 
 They'd say they wanted social infrastructure to support the country 
people.  But they would only steal from the agricultural workers, the 
country people.  They'd tell them, you're going to plant a certain 
variety of peaches, for example, even though it was designed for a 
climate like Kentucky.  How was that going to grow in Caborca?  Or a 
grape variety that grows well in northern Italy, but cannot function in 
the desert here.  They country people to take the loans for this, even 
though they were never going to be able to pay, because they were never 
going to produce.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I changed parties.  I started the 
National Action Party in Sonora because that was the only option at the 
time that fought against the government.  The other parties, like PPS, 
were the servants of the PRI, they were part of them.  And because of 
that I came as a bracero in 1985- 1985 to California.  The government 
was after me.

DB:  When you say as a bracero - are you saying without papers?  Because in 1985 the program did not exist any longer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, undocumented.  I mean I came to 
work illegally in California because the government was following me.  I
 went on a hunger strike of 9 days in Caborca, because my election was 
stolen.  I ran for deputy and it was totally stolen.  There were 8,000 
votes against 4,000.  Two days after the hunger strike, on the 20 of 
June of 1985, we were beaten with sticks by the state police and the 
Caborca's municipal police.  They left me with 2 broken ribs and my 
forehead lacerated.  One of my brothers was beaten, and many others as 
well.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why I came to the United

DB:  So you are a trans-national person, a person with roots on both sides.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am transnational, like you are 
saying.  I have both roots.  I have learned to care a lot about North 
Americans, to love this town [Phoenix] because it is a fighting and 
working town, with all of its vices.  There are rules that don't sit 
well with us, and racism is deeply rooted here. I worked in Minnesota, 
and I'll tell you frankly, there is more racism in Arizona than in 
Minnesota.  But I want people here to understand that we did not come 
here to take.  We came to contribute the little that we have and that we
 know, so that this country functions, so that it develops.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife's mother was born in Ireland, 
but came to Kansas City, Missouri when my wife was 2.  So, my wife has 
completely Anglo roots, so that is why I have those roots too.  But my 
grandmother was Opata, 100% Mexican, and my father was a Mexican from 
Paral, Chihuahua, Pancho Villa's land.  Those are the strong roots, from
 both countries.  My wife is Mexican, not even a permanent resident, 
because her mother never wanted any of her children to take U.S. 
citizenship.  Not one of them, not even her daughters.  They always 
lived in Canada, in Nacozari and in Pitiquito.  My wife's father was the
 municipal president of Nacosari - Gustavo Torres.  There's a bridge in 
Nacosari that has his name on it.  He built it.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that there aren't many 
journalists or people interested in knowing the truth about Murrieta. I 
want to make sure that people understand the message to the government 
and people of the United States.  Our fight as the national association 
of descendants of Joaquin Murrieta is for a better understanding of who 
he was.  It is very clear that he was not a bandit, or the "gringo 
killer".  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to take back the part of 
Mexico that was stolen.  Mexico was mutilated, and he wanted to recover 
part of it, because he loved his country.  Look - now North Americans 
are fighting in Afghanistan, which is not their country, but they were 
hit hard with the horrible terrorist attack in New York.  North 
Americans, if they had seen their country attacked, would have done the 
same thing that Joaquin Murrieta did at that time.   The only thing 
Murrieta did was defend the people from Sonora that were living there, 
to protect themselves and their wives, to keep them from being stripped 
of their land and their earnings, so they wouldn't be forcibly obligated
 to work in the mines and agriculture.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to travel this path, because 
there are many Mexicans here now, and we have to understand each other 
better.
