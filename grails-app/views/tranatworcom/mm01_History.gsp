DB:  Can you describe the history of your family, especially their connection with Joaquin Murrieta and the gold mines?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born August the 14th,1934, in 
Blythe, Ca.  My mother was born in Arizona, on the reservations of the 
Colorado River Indian tribes.  My grandmother, likewise.  My great 
grandmother was married there in Ehrenberg, a port town right across the
 river from Blythe.  Her husband was called Marinero, because he used to
 work on the steam boats which used to come all the way up from Puerto 
Santa Clara down on the Gulf of California, all the way to Callville 
above Lake Mead.  That was before the dams.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mother, Maria de Los Angeles Reyna's 
mother, my great great grandmother, was Teodosa Martinez Murrieta.  She 
was born in La Cienega a little mining town, the first gold mining town 
of northwest Sonora in the Desierto de Altar.  This area was called the 
Golden Triangle because they had three large placer deposits.  The La 
Cienega mine started in 1740.  Most of the gold miners were family, and 
when the Murrietas came, they came because of the gold.  The first 
Murrieta was a soldier, who came to the Presidio de Altar. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main headquarters of northwest 
Sonora was in the Distrito de Atar.  Teodosa Martinez Murrieta was a 
cousin of Joaquin Murrieta.  When they went north, she went with all the
 Sonorenses.  There were 10,000, according to some of the historians.  
The Federal Census of 1850 taken in California substantiates the fact 
that these were the people from Sonora, although in the census it just 
lists their nationality as Mexico.  But very few people came from the 
south of Mexico at that time, so we know that they mean Sonoran people 
because they were the gold-miners.  So my history is all tied in with 
mining.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joaquin Murrieta was a gambusino, a 
placer miner.  My mother's family were all mixed in with the 
Chimahuevos, one of the Colorado Indian Tribes.  My brothers and I 
didn't enroll because my grandfather never wanted to.  He said he didn't
 want to be under the yoke of any form of government, because he wanted 
to be free to roam.  That's why we never did enroll in Parker. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father was from El Rio Yaqui in 
Sonora.  His family came here to the Desierto de Atar in 1905.  He 
worked all the mines all around Trincheras and Caborca.  The first time 
he came to the US was in 1918, during the Bisbee strike.  The Wobblies 
had a big strike there, and a lot of the miners that came from Mexico 
were deported - any foreign miner that had anything to do with the 
union.  And my father joined the union.  My grandfather, prior to him, 
worked in Cananea, and was involved in the early strike there in 1906.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So through both sides we had al lot of
 miners.  My father was a Yaqui Pima, and very independent.  He used to 
tell us that your biggest enemy was your boss.  And his father, all that
 line, were from the Rio Yaqui, towns called Tonichi and San Jose de 
Pima.  Really, Figueroa is a Basque name.  And the first Figueroa came 
to this area in around 1725.  They say that first Basque was a tax 
collector.  He married a Yaqui and they ousted him from the Figueroa 
clan because of it.  But they started intermarrying with more Yaquis and
 Pimas nevertheless.  My father used to speak Yaqui.  And he used to 
dance the Pascola and the Matachin.  He was very independent and when he
 saw any injustices he would intervene and protest.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got a job in the mines as a young 
man, barely 18 years old.  The strike started in Bisbee, and he just got
 involved because everybody struck.  Whether he wanted to or not, he had
 to participate.  After that he worked in other mines in Jerome, in Ruby
 and in Globe-Miami, Arizona.  He worked in Sonora Rey Arizona, called 
that because Rey was the Anglo town and Sonora was the Mexican town.  
They had a big strike there too, and he was involved in a more 
responsible way.  They closed the mine in Rey, and he and his two 
friends left.  They were gonna go to the big mines in Jackson 
California, the gold mines, and on the way they stopped in Oatman, 
Arizona, where my mother's mother, Dolores Mollinedo had a boarding 
house.  The house is still there, one of the few adobe houses. My father
 stayed there to get a job.  His two friends, Domingo Duron and Tirsio 
Ahumada left for California, where the Colton cement and limestone mine 
was starting up.  There in Oatman my father got married to my mother 
Carmen in 1927.  In 1965, my father was real sick with silicosis, and we
 took him to the hospital in Riverside.  And who was there in the 
hospital?  Ahumada and Duron!  Can you imagine?  The three were all sick
 from the same thing.  Their lungs just deteriorated.  My father died of
 silicosis.  His lungs were full of clots.  Blood would come out when he
 spit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My older brothers were baptized in 
Llano, a small town south of Magdalena in Sonora.  They were baptized 
there, and that's where my grandfather on my father's side was buried.  
My grandmother on my father's side is buried in Caborca.
</p>

<p>
DB:  So did your father want you to follow in the same life he led?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never wanted us to work in the big 
mines. We were gambusinos, small mine operators.  The average life of a 
miner is not that long.  My father liked to be on the surface, placer 
mining and panning for gold.  He was very successful in looking for gold
 because he was a connoisseur of minerals.  In Mojave County he would 
always win the prize for knowing just by looking what kind of minerals a
 rock contained, and what the percentages would be roughly.  He would 
always get the blue ribbons.  He wasn't a geologist, but in the old 
days, if you wanted to study to be an engineer or a geologist, you'd 
have to go work with some of these old timers like my father.  In the 
mines you had to know how to timber, to make the stubs, the raises and 
all that.

<p>
DB:  When did the kind of mining your father did begin in California?
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first big gold strike was there 
at Santa Clarita Canyon, just north of San Fernando, in 1841, made by 
Sonoran people.  They lived right south of there - all they had to do 
was cross the desert.  Then they continued moving north through 
California.  These guys were gold miners.  They pursued the gold, and 
they didn't wait for 1849 to come to the gold mines in California.  They
 were working a lot of mines prior to that.
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Sonorans didn't find too 
much gold they would go to look for a new strike.  That's why people are
 still working right here in Trincheras, in the Golden Triangle, because
 of some of the gold was left.  The early miners were greedy - if they 
didn't find that much, they'd go to the next gold strike.  They were 
always looking for the big gold strike.  The original miners reminded of
 the migrants when we used to go pick grapes in Delano, or pitch 
watermelons in Bakersfield.  The miners did the same thing.  They would 
cross the Desierto del Diablo from Sonora to Yuma in the early spring, 
or maybe late winter before it got too hot.  And they'd come back in the
 late fall or beginning of winter to Sonora.  It was the same migration 
of people - up and down, up and down.  They never wanted to leave their 
place of origin. But that stopped in Joaquin Murrieta's times -1852, 
1854.  The people were forced from the gold fields.  The Anglos just 
wanted them to get the hell out.  That was the main purpose of the 
Foreign Miners Tax Act, approved by John Bigler who was then the 
governor of California, and enforced by the vigilante committees in 
Tuolomne and Calaveras Counties.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People don't migrate to the mines 
anymore.  I would say that really stopped completely when the Second 
World War started in 1941.  They had a law passed that no dynamite was 
allowed for mines that were not for national defense.  We were able to 
continue mining after the forties because we were mining maganese.  
Manganese, copper, and lead were minerals for national defense.  I 
worked 11 years in the manganese.  And in between I worked some lead and
 copper.  But the bulk of the miners'  migrations closed down at the 
beginning of WWII.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  Teodosa Martinez Murrieta must have been a pretty remarkable woman to go with the miners from Sonora to California.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a very strong woman.  My aunts
 used to hate her guts because she was just so cruel and mean. She died 
at 107 years old, in 1931, and was buried in Parker, Arizona.  She had a
 homestead on the river at Parker, and her family worked the mines there
 - McCracklin, Signal and others - real good mines.  But then my great 
great grandfather got old, and they started planting vegetables.  The 
railroad passed through, and they would sell vegetables to the railroad 
towns.  One day, my great great grandfather took his cart and all the 
vegetables to town, thirty miles away.  He didn't come back for more 
than two weeks.  He had 19 kids, and it was bad.  They didn't have 
anything to eat because he'd taken most of the food down to Wendon.  So 
my great grandma sent my uncle to see her mother, who was working at a 
boarding house in King of Arizona, in the Koffa mountains between Yuma 
and Quartzite.  And sure enough there was the old man, drunk as a skunk 
with a bunch of leaches that used to hang around there and wait for this
 poor sucker to show up.  She got him with a shotgun, tied him up in a 
buck board, and told him, "Next time you abandon your family, I'm gonna 
come and kill you with a shotgun." She wouldn't have hesitated to shoot 
my great great grandfather.  She was tough and rough. My great 
grandmother had a stiff arm because they say that one time my great, 
great grandmother got mad at her and threw her against a wall and broke 
it.  We know she was just a meany.  When we hear that she came the first
 time in 1847 to California with all the guys from Sonora, we know 
that's pretty close to the truth cause she was one of those hard ladies.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used to say, according to my 
uncles, that she was Joaquin Murrieta's cousin.  They were part of the 
Murrieta family.  There were very few Murrietas that came at that time -
  just three men - Salvador, David Jose, and Juan.  Juan was Joaquin 
Murrieta's father.  Those are three that spread most of the Murrietas 
that we have right now.  They really came from San Rafael de Los 
Alamitos.

<p>
DB:  So you learned all this in your childhood?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I had the most wonderful 
childhood anybody could ever think of.  I was born in Blythe but when my
 the mines opened up again we went to Oatman, and lived there from 1936 
to 1941, when the mines closed again.  We had to come back to Blythe.  
That's when they opened up a big air base and George Patton had his 
headquarters in Blythe and lots of guys training there.  So there was a 
lot of work., and my father started working as a cement finisher and in 
the manganese mines.  Racism was rampant,  We always fought Gringos, and
 we always won.  My brothers were fighters and we were a big family.  We
 weren't pushovers.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education department used to have 
Americanization schools where you didn't advance.  It was just to retard
 you really, similar to the Indian boarding schools. They should have 
called them brainwashing schools.  I didn't go, so that's why my 
thinking has been a lot different from that of my buddies, who did. Hell
 they were 9 years old and still in the first grade.  It was just awful!
  When they got out of school, after 6th or 7th grade, they had to pick 
cotton.  I barely picked cotton one day in my - we were always in the 
mines.  My buddies that worked picking cotton didn't go to school. and 
my mother was always very adamant that we go. Blythe had its high school
 since 1916.  When I graduated, just 5 Chicanos graduated with me out of
 around 100 students.  When I entered that high school in 1947, only 4 
Chicanos had graduated in all its history.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were the majority of people in town
 and the Blacks were a small minority.  But more Blacks graduated from 
school than we did because they used to grade them according to how many
 pounds of cotton they picked.  They didn't come to the school - they 
worked for the grower.  He would say how many pounds each picked that 
week, and that's how they graded them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My older brother, Mike Figueroa, was 
the first Chicano to work in the post office.  It was a big deal!  My 
mother would say, "My son works in the post office."  And all the other 
ladies would say, "Ooohhh!"  But my father criticized the hell out of 
Mike.  "You're gonna be a domestic slave!  You're always gonna have that
 damn yoke on your back," he'd say. "This is one of the worst things you
 could have ever done." My brother had just graduated from high school, 
and at the time we were making a living by making charcoal out of iron 
wood, something we used to do in between times in the mines. We were 
making ovens out of 16 cords of wood - like little mountains.  So my 
brother got mad and threw his axe away.  Mike said, "I'm gonna go to 
town and get me a job!"  And my father said, "You know nobody is gonna 
give you a job!"  Because they didn't give Mexicans a job - nobody 
worked in town.  You were supposed to work in the damn fields.  That's 
why my father was so independent - because working in the mines you're 
your own boss.  So Mike started from one end of town and went all the 
way up, putting in applications.  Finally he landed that job in the post
 office.  My brother was a brain - he was the only male who knew how to 
take short hand. When he took the civil service exam he passed it with 
flying colors. 
</p>

<p>
DB:  You guys really had to fight for everything.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we were always on the winning 
side.  We always won.  My other brother Gilbert was el asote - the guy 
with the big blow.  My brother never lost a fight in Blythe.  You didn't
 mess with the Figueroas.  When Mike was a small kid the teacher would 
come and say, "Okay children, it's recess."  But Mike didn't go out.  
They'd say, "Well, Mike doesn't play."  That was a joke that was all 
over town.  Mike had run ins with cops and immigration officers, and 
he'd always take care of business.  He used to criticize me for getting 
involved with Cesar Chavez and this non-violent business.  But my 
character's a lot different.  He's fortunate that he's never been shot 
or incarcerated.  Oh he was incarcerated one time when he was fighting 
with my brothers.  The cop took him to jail and they were 12 years old! 
 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a small kid in 3rd grade we
 were starting geography.  The teacher pointed to a map on the wall and 
said, "Now this is the United States that we all love so much." I got up
 like an Indian and raised my hand and said, "Well I don't love it too 
much."  She asked, "What do you mean?  You don't know what you're 
talking about!"  I said, "My father says they stole this land from us." I
 wouldn't change my mind, so they sent me home and told my mother I was 
unpatriotic.  They kept me away for two weeks.  They took me to the 
principal's office, where he had a big old paddle they used to call the 
board of education.  And they paddled and whipped me.  They made a play 
named after Philip Nolan's book, Man Without a Country, and showed it at
 school, just to intimidate the Mexicans.  They named it Boy Without a 
Country.  I was just telling them, "This is my land." I was just a 
little kid.  Can you imagine, 9 years old?  Man!  But that's why  they 
had the Americanization schools, to brainwash all those young Mexicans 
and Chimahuevos living in Blythe.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother always used to say that we 
were Chimahuevos and my father was Yaqui.  We never did classify 
ourselves as American.  Never!  It was a battle everyday, and we knew 
who we were.  My mother negotiated with the principal, and I had to 
write on the blackboard, "I love the United States" in front of all the 
kids a hundred times.  And then I was accepted back as a student at 
Blythe grammar school.

head off, and displayed it in the church tower.

<p>
DB:  So part of the reason for your family's attitude came from the fact they were miners?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, mining gave us a lot of 
independence.  But the workers who worked for the big mines were not 
this way.  We had a big mine in Blythe, United States Gypsum Company. My
 father and his friends could never get a union going there.  Some of 
the guys had been working there for 30 years.  They had the company 
stores there.  All the houses were owned by the United States Gypsum 
Company.  And the people were just like property of the mines too.  
Once, when my father was working there the foreman came and said, "Hey 
Figueroa!  How come you're not in there?"  My father said, "Well, you go
 in there."  The foreman answered, "No.  It's too dusty."  My father 
told him, "That's exactly why I'm not in there!  Because I'm not gonna 
leave my lungs there!  I left them already in Arizona and I'm not gonna 
do it no more!  You put some water in there!"  You see, when they were 
drilling they never had water to control the dust, so the guys used 
their bandanas when they were working down in the shaft or in the 
tunnels.  It was dusty as hell!  Water would stop the dust, but they 
didn't want to do it.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unions were going all over Arizona
 - the Mine Mill Union - but not in California.  My father used to say 
the miners there were just dominated by the bosses. But they used to pay
 a lot better then working in the fields, so they thought it was a damn 
good job.

DB:  What did the border mean to your family when you were growing up?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People would come to Caborca because 
there'd be big happenings there.  They would just migrate back and 
forth. It was two to one, the dollar and the peso.  But after the war, 
things started changing a lot.  It started with the money - eight to 
one, twelve to one.  Then it got, I don't know how many hundreds to one 
and you needed a wheelbarrow to exchange.  But in those early days there
 was more difference between Sonora and southern Mexico than Sonora and 
Arizona.  In Sonora and Arizona they eat menudo blanco.  In the south 
it's red because they put chile in it.  In Sonora people eat the flour 
tortilla.  In the south it's all corn.  It's not so good for us.  The 
flour tortilla really gives you diabetes, but everybody loves them.  
Padre Kino got people started growing wheat, and that's what changed it.
  Even our language is more similar than we are to the south.  Sonora 
and Arizona - we're all the same people.  Even the Treaty of Guadalupe 
and the border didn't change the custom.  We have the same food and the 
same manner of speech.  We use a lot of words that blend Spanish with 
Opota and Yaqui.  And people from the south don't understand that.  All 
the mining terms here are mixed like that, and  everybody here was a 
miner.

DB:  What were the differences between miners and farmworkers?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miners were sort of the elite.  A 
miner always had a damn good shoe and a damn good hat. Friday, Saturday,
 and Sunday they'd get decked out and do their thing.  On the farms, 
they were always domestic slaves. I used to have a service station where
 I saw the injustices people suffered. At that time we had 5000 Braceros
 in Palo Verde. The growers association was right there in front of us, 
where all the workers would come to get paid.  Then they would cash 
their checks at our service station.  So I would see their checks - 
zero, zero, zero.  The contractor would charge them for everything.  If 
the grower needed a hundred workers they'd sent 200 to do the job, and 
the people would only be able to work half the time.  Most of the time 
they'd spend at the labor camp, spending the little money they got.  So 
when they got their check, it was zero, zero, zero, zero.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother was more involved than I 
was at that time.  He used to get all the complaints when they'd go down
 to the post office, because he was the only guy that spoke Spanish.  So
 we became involved in politics at that time.  We used to call the 
Mexican Consul about the  violations. He'd come down, but before he got 
there they'd clean the showers.  They'd put clean sheets on the beds and
 give the workers a steak dinner.  Then the guy would say, "What's wrong
 with you guys?  There's nothing happening here.  Everything's good."  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960 they started big strikes with 
the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee down in Calexico, and we 
went down there.  They wanted to continue the strike when the harvest 
came to Blythe, and then Salinas. I was going to be the organizer in 
Blythe, so we went to Imperial Valley to get involved with AWOC. At that
 time, Mexico was supposed to get one million five hundred thousand acre
 feet of the Colorado's water. Out of the river's fifteen million acre 
feet of water, seven states get water from the Calorado, plus Mexico. 
But Mexico never has gotten it's share.  In addition, the river's water 
was too alkali, because they were opening the Gila River watershed, and 
using the river to wash all those lands. When they flooded the land, the
 alkali rose, and was drained through the ditches, down to the river.  
The whole cotton crop in the Mexicali Valley grew less then 18 inches 
high because the water was so salty.  Every time farmers would irrigate 
in Mexocali it would ruin more of their crops.  My cousin Oscar had a 
big ranch there and had to leave it. So on the Mexican side at this time
 people had a big issue, and on our side we had a major issue about the 
braceros, and the way they were being mistreated.  They  began to call 
big meetings between the small farmers from the Mexicali side and us in 
the AWOC from the California side to try to talk to each other.  We'd 
meet right at the  border.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kennedy had just been elected.  He 
called Al Green, the head of AWOC out of Stockton.  He asked AWOC to 
stop the strike because they didn't want to create an incident in the 
border when Kennedy had just come on board.  We couldn't win the strike 
anyway because of the braceros.  When we would try to advise them their 
rights they were deported. So Robert Kennedy stopped the strike.  He did
 some good things, but in that incident he didn't.   I didn't stay too 
long down there cause it was too damn rough.  And it was an endless 
fight.  And right away, the whole effort was closed down because we 
didn't have the support of the AFL-CIO any longer.  What the hell were 
we doing out there? So I just went back to Blythe.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we came back, the growers already
 knew we'd been in the Imperial Valley.  They took us to the Farmers 
Merchant Bank.  You should have seen the third degree they gave us.  
They couldn't give me much trouble because I didn't work for them.  But 
Mike worked in the post office. So they said, "What are you Figueroas 
doing down in Imperial Valley?  Don't you know everybody there has guns?
  We have a real nice atmosphere here in Blythe.  I know your father, 
and your mother, your grandmother.  Why would you want to go down there?
  If you guys need a job, or you want to get a loan, we'll give you 
one." The Farmers and Merchants Bank was the big bank in Blythe.  The 
head bank people were all growers. I didn't give a damn, but my brother 
was fired from the post office.  But he sued them in 1960 and won.  And 
that's one good thing Robert Kennedy did - he fought for my brother.  
One day Kennedy called him at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and told him 
his case had been settled.  They finally gave him his check in 1963, and
 it was a big one.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the cops beat the hell out of me 
in 1963, here in my hometown, on our street.  They dragged me from one 
of my favorite bars.  I was in the El Sarape Cafe, right beside the 
place where we later had the union office.  And I was singing to the 
owner.  I'll sing anywhere.  No big deal.  But here come these three 
cops and they thought I was drunk. I was actually drinking a 7-Up, just 
getting ready to go home after I had finished eating.  So one cop, who 
didn't know beans about Chicanos, says, "Those guys are crazy as hell.  
Look how they're carrying on!"  So they said to me, "Oh, you want to 
come outside."  I said, "Hell no, I'm not going to come!"  Because I 
knew what would happen.  "You know you guys are barking up the wrong 
tree," I said.  But they thought I was a smart ass bracero who knew  a 
little English. And right there, they grabbed my arms and my legs and 
threw me against the bar.  Then they handcuffed me and threw me out of 
the door.  My face hit the sidewalk, and they dragged me to the car.  
Then they kicked me and tried to wedge me into the back door.  I said, 
"This will be the last Mexican you'll ever kick!"  They laughed at me.  
"That's what all you guys say!" But we had a new judge in town, and that
 changed everything. I won my case and then I sued them.  And I was the 
first Chicano in the United States to win a police brutality suit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That turned my whole life around.  I 
said to myself, okay gringos, here we come, with facts and figures and 
organization, to get people to register and vote.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of animosity against 
the braceros at that time, because the growers wouldn't give jobs to the
 local Mexicans.  Finally they passed a law that said that growers first
 had to deplete the sources of local workers.  That's what they used to 
call us - the locals.  Then, if they didn't find enough locals, they 
could hire braceros.  But you know, they never did that.  Finally, the 
braceros all were returned in 1964, on December 31st. To this day we're 
still trying to get the 10% of the wages due to the braceros that was 
withheld while they were working, but never returned to them when they 
finished their contracts from 1942 to 1964.  If it hadn't been for MAPA 
(the Mexican American Political Association) and Bert Corona, Public Law
 78 and the bracero program would have been extended.  But thanks to our
 efforts, we were able to stop that damn law.  And as soon as that 
happened, in 1965 , AWOC and the Filipinos struck.  Just like it says in
 the song, "el dia ocho de septiembre de los compos de Delano salieron 
los Filipinos."  And if it hadn't been for the Filipinos beginning that 
strike, Cesar wouldn't have gone on strike either, because he thought 
the time was not yet opportune.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing happening during 
that span from 1960 to 64. Cesar was organizing the Association, trying 
to make contacts, but nothing major.   I knew Cesar in 1949.  Cesar got 
married in 50 to Helen Favela, and her sister, Teresa Favela, married 
our next door neighbor in Blythe in our neighborhood of Barrio Cuchillo.
 So naturally when we used to go pick grapes in Delano every summer, 
we'd see Cesar and his family. All the family would work, and we were 
teenagers.  We'd work in the watermelons too.  I've been pitching 
watermelons all my damn life, since I was ten years old.  That's how we 
got to know Cesar.  And when Cesar began the association, people started
 to say, "Hey, remember Cesar?  Well, he's starting a union - Mexican 
union."  The guys from AWOC were making $125 dollars a week at that 
time, and they used have a 1960 car.  Now this Mexican, Cesar, is going 
to start a union and fight these growers?  So, I went to meet with Cesar
 in Santa Barbara and started working together in the beginning of 1966.
  The grape strike had already started.

DB:  So what does Joaquin Murrieta have to do with this modern history?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joaquin Murrieta is the grandfather of
 our Chicano movement.  He was the one that intervened right after the 
treaty of Guadelupe Hidalgo, which was signed on February the 2nd, 1848.
  All my life I knew about him. Joaquin Murrieta is a symbol, as 
important to us as Cuauhtemoc, the last of the Aztecs.  When Cortez 
landed, Cuauhtemoc said "The sun is gone from our sight.  It's become 
obscured."  He said that on August 12, 1521.  And on August the 13th he 
was captured - the most sacred day of the year in the Aztec calendar.  
Now, after all this time has passed, we are learning the truth. And why 
has the time come now to tell it?  The story of Joaquin Murrieta is part
 of the whole transformation of our way of thinking.  People now want to
 learn the truth.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chicano movement just didn't start
 in the 60's or the 50's. Chix-Zanotl means vanguard in Nahuatl - 
vanguard of their treasures.  Gradually over time it became bastardized 
to Chicano.  And the name kept appearing - Zapata's main escorts were 
called Los Chicanos.  When  Hidalgo started the movement to become 
independent of Spain, he used the name of los Chicanos too.

<span class="sm">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the height of today's Chicano 
movement in the 1960s people started to recognize Joaquin Murrieta as 
one of our heroes.  Corky Gonzalez made a poem about him, Yo Soy 
Joaquin.  That really energized people.  And that's what people were 
seeking - a way not to be so ashamed about being Mexican. Joaquin 
Murrieta was the main core, the symbol of liberation, the light to guide
 us so we could again regain our true identity.  We were fighting for 
justice and Joaquin Murrieta was the justifier because he fought against
 tremendous odds.  And that's what we're doing right now.  I mean 
traditional people - we're fighting against tremendous odds.  This 
capitalistic government is like the spider that grabs you  in its web.  
He didn't succeed in achieving his ultimate goal, but he succeeded in 
organizing his people to fight.  And that was very very noble.  He was 
fighting for justice and that's one of the things that we were saying in
 the 60s.  We were fighting for our rights, just to be heard.  We were 
fighting not to go into that damn army and to Vietnam.  So we needed 
somebody that could lead people in their thinking.  Joaquin Murrieta 
really stood out among all the other symbols of Chicanismo.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never read a book about him until 
1958.  Everything I knew of Joaquin Murrieta was oral history.  When I 
was ten years old I could sing the Corrido of Joaquin Murrieta.  And in 
1975 I was taken to Washington DC where I sang the corrido with my 
daughters and sons.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1900's my grandfathers 
were thrown in jail in and Parker because they sang the Corrido of 
Joaquin Murrieta. My grand fathers were very proud of being descendants 
of Murrieta, so they would get drunk and start singing the song. The 
sheriff spoke Spanish, and he knew what they were singing, so he would 
arrest them because it was against the law.  You could not sing El 
Corrido de Joaquin Murrieta - it was outlawed in California and Arizona.
  They were prohibited from singing that song on the radio too.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a saying in our Association of
 the Descendents of Joaquin Murrieta.  We have to know who we are.  We 
have to know where we're going.  Once you're on solid ground, you'll go 
forward.  Nothing will stop you.  If they bump you off it's no big deal.
 Joaquin Murrieta is the symbol of that spirit.  People now are not 
afraid to say they're descendants of Murrieta.  That's been my greatest 
satisfaction.  I've invested years of organizing these fiestas in Las 
Trincheras, where he lived and the Murrietas still live.  The thing was 
to make people understand - there was a Murrieta.  We did fight.  He 
wasn't just a murderer, but someone who would fight for justice.  He was
 trying to raise an army.  They portrayed him as a horse thief, but he 
was trying to get 2,000 horses for 2,000 men, to form a cavalry and join
 with the Californios to take over California again. They were very 
dissatisfied after the foreign miner's tax was enacted in 1850.  That 
was the law that broke the camel's back.  If it hadn't been for that, 
the merging of the two cultures would have been a lot easier, instead of
 the hostilities that took place during the early 1850's.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why they never could find him. 
 Every house that was Sonoran knew him, or was related to him in some 
way.  They harbored him and protected him, up and down the state of 
California.  He was always incognito as far as the authorities were 
concerned because he had so many allies.  These people just tried to 
defend what was theirs, but to do that they had to organize a 
clandestine movement.  They had no choice.  That's why Murrieta was 
tried and sentenced without the authorities ever knowing who he was.  
And he had this kind of support because the Sonoran miners were all from
 the same area.  They knew each other.  Eventually, the great bulk of 
them went back to Sonora.  They left the upper part of California 
because the law kept them from working their mines.  They didn't want to
 suffer the consequences of staying, and the consequences were that they
 would kill you.  The names on the lists of the people hung by the 
vigilantes in the goldfields of those years are all Spanish.  So when 
they killed these people, the rest just left voluntarily.  That was the 
agreement.  If you left voluntarily, you could leave freely.  But if you
 stayed, you were going to suffer the consequences.  The first woman 
hung in California, in 1853, was named Juanita.  According to the last 
California Ranger, William Howard, her last words were "Viva Joaquin 
Murrieta!"

DB:  So what impact did learning about Joaquin Murrieta have on your own ideas?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realized that we're one people, 
whether we live in Arizona or California or Sonora - one continent, one 
world. I'm anti-nationalistic borders.  To me, there's no such thing as a
 new world and an old world.  That's the truth of the Murrieta legend.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today there's a resurgence, and people
 are very proud.  Everywhere you go in Trincheras they'll say, "Viva 
Joaquin Murrieta!"   The teachers in the schools have more information, 
and students make plays about him.  They named the main street Calle 
Joaquin Murrieta.  From California we brought 10,000 dollars worth of 
medical supplies to the local clinic, and I was able to negotiate with 
Blythe Ambulance Services to donate an ambulance.  Up north in 
California they've started Joaquin Murrieta Day in Mendota, in the San 
Joaquin Valley, where his group was ambushed on July 25, 1853.  Avenue 
63 there was changed to Joaquin Murrieta Avenue. Eventually we want to 
take a caravan of horses and riders all the way from Mendota to 
Trincheras, across the border.  If we can get both governments involved 
we can probably do it.  We already have permission from the big ranches 
along the way, and we know where the old trail used to go. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our goals is to have the state 
government of Sonora declare Murrieta's birthday a state holiday.  It's 
not just a symbol with no meaning.  I think it's going to change 
people's whole attitude about how government policies and educational 
institutions apply to them.  It contributes to peoples' well being, 
because they realize that our history, the basis of our traditions, 
wasn't something false or blind, but based on hard core facts.  We want 
to rescue our history from the lies our governments have told us for so 
long.  Our history isn't just something from an academic publication, 
but traditions taught from early childhood that help us understand what 
life means, what it stands for.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexico is nearly as bad as the United 
States.  It has a constitution that supports workers and campesinos, 
where the word labor appears 36 times.  The United States constitution 
doesn't have one word about workers.  But in Mexico, they don't enforce 
it.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some ways, Mexico's just a 
stepchild of the United States.  And the problems between the two 
countries go on and on.  The other day we had a ceremony in Holtville, 
remembering the 600 undocumented people who died last year trying to 
cross the border.  Many are buried there in the Holtville cemetery, and 
no one knows their names.  John Doe, John Doe, John Doe.  Can you 
imagine?  They were trying to cross the desert, just like the miners did
 from Sonora, 150 years ago.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you seen the concrete ditch along
 the border in Tijuana, with the iron plates sticking up with the razor 
wire on the top?  The racial discrimination and hostility against 
Mexicans is still the same but in a different day.  Who brought the 
National Guard down to the border, and who built that damn wall?  So 
things haven't changed so much after all.  These things were happening 
in 1848 and they're still happening right now in 2001.
