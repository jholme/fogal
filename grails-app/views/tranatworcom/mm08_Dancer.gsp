</span></p>

<p>
DB:  Where and when were you born?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in a clinic in Navojoa in 
1980 on the 14th of October.  My parents lived in Los Nachuquis, and we 
still live there.
</p>

<p>
DB:  How long have you been dancing as the deer?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began dancing 6 years ago at fiestas
 and events in our communities.  I was 15 then, and I'm still doing it. 
 I enjoy it a lot.

Pamfilo Lopez Ozuna, the deer dancer.

</p>

<p>
DB:  Your father was also a deer, wasn't he?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, my father danced for 27 years.  When I started to dance, he stopped dancing to be with me.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  Can you tell me how you began dancing?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started I didn't know how to 
dance.  I'd never even been to a fiesta to see it.  But suddenly  I told
 my dad, "You know what, I want to dance."  He said, "Well get the 
sonajas.  [Sonajas are the ankle and wrist bands made of nuts, that make
 the sound when a dancer is dancing.]  Put the deer on your head and 
start dancing, so I can see you how you do it and send you."  I told 
him, "You know what, I'm not going to dance for you.  If you want to 
send me, you'll send me.  If you don't, then I'll never dance."  That's 
what I told him.  So he said, "That's fine.  When I get the fiestas 
scheduled, I'll send you."  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he did.  He sent me on December 
12th, 1995.  He said, "You know what, you're going to go dance at Santa 
Maria Baraje.  That's when you'll figure out how to do it."  That's how I
 started.  I didn't know how to do it beforehand.  Nobody told me 
anything, nobody scolded me.  Nobody said, "You did this wrong or that 
wrong."  For me it was good.  I do it all the same way now as I did when
 I started.  I dance. 
</p>

<p>
DB:  Did your father go to this first fiesta with you?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, my father didn't go with me.  
According to him he sent a friend so that he could tell me how to do it -
  let me know what I was going to have to do.  But it turned out that I 
didn't need him.  I did everything that I was supposed to do and he 
never said anything to me.
</p>

<p>
DB:  How did you know how to put on the deer costume?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never saw my father dress, but 
before I started dancing, I saw it in my dreams.  I saw a large field in
 my hometown, and I dreamed about a fawn there jumping and jumping.  
Then a large serpent attacked me.  The fawn told me what to do.  At 
first the little animal was in shock, and then he took me jumping.  With
 his little head he told me to follow him.  So I followed him to where 
his parents were - a female deer and a male deer.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had no idea that I was going to 
dance, but I kept dreaming this.  I wanted to return and he called out 
to me even more.  When I got to this place, I would touch all the little
 animals.  My father says that's where I picked everything up without 
him telling me.  Then I started to dream about the fiesta and what it 
would be like.  That's how I learned to dress myself.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  Does your father help you or encourage you now?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just the first party, when I 
danced without him being there.  Now, thank God he's with me.  He helps 
me with the anhueja [a drum made from a gourd, the sits in a tub of 
water while it's being played] and with the group of musicians that I 
lead.  At the same time, he watches me when I don't know what to do, or 
when he doesn't know what to do.  We take care of each other, mutually. 
 When someone is harming him, or knows more than he does, then I help 
him.  Or if he knows more than someone who's harming me, then he helps 
me.  That's how we help each other.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  He shares his experiences with you and at the same time you give him advice?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel comfortable because he helps 
me.  At the same time, he's old, and I'm new and young.  What he 
couldn't learn, I have been able to learn, thank God, and have helped 
him.  We feel comfortable sharing what we know or what we see at the 
fiestas.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  Why do you dance?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I like it.  I like it without 
knowing why or how.  I wanted to dance before I went to the fiestas, 
without knowing what it was like, or about the jealously among the 
dancers and musicians.  Like they say, wanting to dance was born within 
me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am dancing I thank the saint 
that I'm dancing for - whether it's Christ, San Juan, Santa Maria, San 
Jose, or any other.  I gladly dance.  When the fiesta starts, I focus on
 the saint and give thanks for being able to learn, for knowing what I 
know.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  You started new things with the deer dance, didn't you?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, after I began to know a lot about
 the dance, I started to see different things.  At first, you don't know
 the elements that exist in it.  But then the dance becomes like a habit
 you're used to.  Now I see many different possibilities, and at the 
same time I have fun.  When I dance, I sometimes get lost.  I don't even
 know what I'm doing.  Other people tell me, "You know what you did 
this, and that other thing."  But at the time I'm lost.  Because when I 
dance, I dance.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  Have you seen other deer dancers?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I have.  In the town where I live
 there are two more dancers.  Many people tell me, "You leave them at 
the bottom."  When they dance, they don't get a crowd.  When I dance, I 
fill the place.  Many people tell me that I do it differently from other
 people.  I don't even dance like my dad.  They ask me who taught me, 
and I tell them that I taught myself.  Thank God that what I know, no 
one has taught me.  I see alone, I learn by imitating the things that 
are in the world.  What I know is what I made up, not what others taught
 me.
</p>

<p>
DB:  Are you doing things to develop your dancing style?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.  All the time.  You have to look 
for different things to distinguish yourself from other dancers.   They 
can be new things, or thing from the ancestors that people are now 
learning again.  I look forward and backwards.

</div>
</p>

<p>
DB:  When you're looking for the past, who do you talk to get ideas about what they did?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well logically, to look for stuff in 
the past, you have to ask the older people, like my father or others 
that know how they did things before.  The new things are ones I don't 
look for.  They are the things that I see along the way and that I do.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  Where do the new ideas come from?  During your dance you open a 
bottle, something that other dancers didn't do until you started doing 
it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started I was dancing no one 
had ever put out a bottle for anyone.  But while I was dancing in one 
fiesta, a man approached me.  He said, "You're from my home town, and I 
want you to show my friend here that in my town we know how to do 
things."  I never imagined that he was going to put a bottle out there 
where I was dancing, but he did.  He put a beer bottle out there.  It 
took me two hours of dancing without knowing what to do with that 
bottle.  My head was spinning and spinning, thinking of the way that I 
was going to do it.  Until I had it.  So I said, "I'm going to open it 
with my mouth, and if I can't, then too bad."  I focused and I opened 
it, and I felt an overwhelming feeling of satisfaction.  I felt good to 
have been able to accomplish something that others have never been able 
to do.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  What have you found from the past that is part of your dance?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, they used to just dance to the
 drums, play the harp,  and the anhueja.  Now I get on top of the bule 
[the big maraca] or on top of the anhueja [the drum played in the 
water]. This is something that was done by my ancestors, but then people
 stopped for a long time until I began again.  It's not easy, and I'm 
still the only one doing it.  It's not only that you have to balance, 
but it's very easy to break the gourd.   
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's how it's been.  Doing what can be done and what can't, too bad. 
</p>

<p>
DB:  Did you get the opportunity to go to high school?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.  I finished high school, but I 
didn't go to college or SEBETIS [one of the three teaching colleges in 
Navojoa, where the schools maintain student dance troupes doing 
indigenous Mayo dances].  I went to take the exams and I did well, but 
there was no money.  That's where it ended.  My father said, "I have no 
money to give you."  I told him, "I'm going to work this year and start 
the following year."  But once you start earning money, you get used to 
having it and spending it.
</p>

<p>
DB:  So you started to work before you danced?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.  I started working even before I 
started high school.  During that time people in my family got sick and 
my parents went to help them and left me alone.  In order to finish high
 school, I polished shoes, earning money to buy my uniform, books, 
notebooks, and pens.  After high school, I couldn't find any good jobs, 
so I started working in the fields.  Then I started to dance.  One week,
 I'd work in the fields.  Then the next there wasn't any work, so I 
danced.  That's how it went.  I never really liked working in the 
fields.  I suffered when I was in high school, but now, I don't so much.
</p>

<p>
DB:  Do you have a family of your own now?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I'm married and have a 7-month 
baby.  I got married here in Rancho Camargo.  I didn't get married 
through the church.   We say, "I got married by the "Law of the 
Mountain."  That's what they say when one steals a girl - marries her 
without her family's permission.  I had a civil marriage later, when the
 baby was going to be born.  I have a boy, and I like him a lot. 
</p>

<p>
DB:  Do you think that perhaps he too will be a dancer?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, when he hears sounds, like at a 
fiesta, he looks alert, and starts moving and dances.  But who knows if 
he'll like it in the future?  Only he will be able to decide what he 
wants to do.
</p>

<p>
DB:  At the fiesta here there was a young boy dancing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he's around 6 or 7 years old. 
 I don't know for sure, but I do know that he dances very well.  He has 
the desire to dance, to learn.  But I don't know if he will dedicate his
 time to dance or to studying.  He's the only one who knows.

</p>

<p>
DB:  He has to choose between the two?  He can't do both?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he could do both.  He's only 
going to study or dance for as long as he wants.  No one can obligate 
him, or tell him, "you have to dance" or "you have to study."  No.  Only
 he can judge how far he's going to take either one.

<p>
DB:  What are the challenges of being a dancer?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a dancer and studying to have a 
career are very similar.  With dancing you have to learn just the same 
as with anything else.  There's jealously among dancers, and when you 
follow a career there's jealously there too.  You have to know how to 
take care of yourself and how to move forward.  In dancing, you can also
 teach, just like you can in other kinds of work.  In some ways dancing 
is different, but it depends on how you look at it.  In many ways 
dancing and studying to have some other career are the same thing.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dancing there's no Social 
Security [Mexico's national health care program] the way there is with 
other kinds of work.  Teachers, give thanks to God, have Social 
Security, and can go and get treated if they're sick.  With dancing, 
there is none.  If you get sick, you learn how to treat yourself, how to
 take care of yourself and how to treat others.  You learn and don't 
forget these things.  If you want to heal then you will heal.
</p>

<p>
DB:  How do you feel when you're dancing?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm dancing I think about 
everything.  I imagine things.  I think about the saint I'm dancing to 
because you'll never make people happy.  The saint you're dancing to 
will be happy.  I think about him and focus on him when I dance.  I pray
 that nothing bad will happen to me or that nothing will fail.  I focus,
 and thank God, I'm here today.  Maybe I won't be here tomorrow, but if 
I'm not, too bad.

<br>
<p>
DB:  Your father speaks the Mayo dialect?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he does.  I hardly speak it, but I
 understand it more or less.  My father's old - he understands and 
speaks very well.  I want to learn it, to speak it - to able to speak to
 people in the dialect.  It's very much needed in an officio [someone 
who performs a traditional religious function, like the deer dance].   
I'm learning little bit at a time, thank God.  When I feel ready, to 
speak it, then logically, I'll speak it.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  Do you see the dancing that you do as a way to preserve the Mayo culture?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.  We, the new people, are learning
 what our ancestors gave us.  We are trying to follow the culture that 
the ancient ones left behind because the culture is beautiful.  They did
 lovely things. We don't want it to end because all of it is so 
beautiful.
</p>

<p>
DB:  Can you support your family with what you're earning dancing?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can support my family.  We don't put
 a price on the dance we do at the fiesta.  An offering is not something
 that you charge for.  An offering is when you dance to the saints and 
not the people.  If the people want to give us something, that is 
because of their good will.  Usually it's between 200 and 1000 pesos, 
but we don't put a price on it.  When we dance, we never know how much 
we're going to earn.  Thank God, we have earned well.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm not dancing, I have to work 
in the fields.  From that work, I bring home the food we eat.  That's 
how I support my family and buy the groceries.  From the fiestas and 
from the fields, we have enough to eat and I can clothe everyone.  I'm 
fine.  Thank God it's possible.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife does not work.  She dedicates 
her time to the home.  I support them and help them by myself, and if 
I'm able to, I buy them something extra. 
</p>

<p>
DB:  Isn't it difficult to work in the fields, considering the times you have to go away to dance?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not too much work, and in the 
fields I can get permission to go dancing.  The days that I don't dance,
 I go to work.  We don't fight about it.  I think the people we work for
 are Arabic.  We harvest zucchini, chiles and tomatoes, and we weed for 
them.  They treat us well because we have work there all year around.   
 
</p>

<p>
DB:  And how much do you earn working in the fields for a week?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, a week's work doesn't even come 
up to two fiestas.  In one fiesta, a simple one, we earn what we would 
in 3 days of work in the fields.  In the fields it's only 60 pesos per 
day.  In three days you don't earn 200 pesos.  Sometimes you can earn 
200 pesos in one fiesta.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  Don't you get tired after dancing day and night?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because your body is used to it - 
your mind, everything is used to it.  I've danced for 8 days straight at
 different places.  
</p>

<p>
DB:  What are you thinking about your own future and your family's future?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, for my own future, I pray to God
 that everything goes well and that I can continue forward.  That work 
never ends, so that I'll continue to be able to support my wife and my 
child.  I ask God for work and the fiestas.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have come to my house, asking 
me to teach their son or nephew how to dance, so that later they will 
have someone to leave in my place.  I tell them that I would be happy to
 teach him so that he can fill my place when I no longer dance.  To 
continue doing what I did, and to do more than what I did.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no more to say other than I 
thank God that everything has turned out well.  I hope God will help me 
do a good job and that I can travel far and see other places.
