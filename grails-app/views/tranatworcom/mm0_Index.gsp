<p class="lg">Miners &amp; Mayos</p>

<p class="twc">
Communities of working people that exist simultaneously in both the US 
and Mexico are older than the border itself.  Before the Treaty of 
Guadalupe Hidalgo took most of the US southwest from Mexico in 1848, 
placer miners -- gambosinos -- migrated between Sonora, Arizona and Alta
 California.  Their descendents still live in both countries.  The old 
gold mining communities of Sonora are disappearing, yet the memory of 
Joaquin Murrieta is more important than ever.  Two interviews document 
the historical influence of the Murrieta family, both on US Chicanos and
 on their descendents in Mexico.  
</p>

<p class="twc">
From early in the 20th century, copper miners from the same families 
have worked in modern industrial mines in Cananea, Nacozari and the 
mining towns of Arizona and New Mexico.  The links to the north, of 
families and common work, have provided important support during 
strikes.  A series of interviews record two instances, one during the 
1960s and another in 1998.  As a result of the transformation of Cananea
 by privatization, globalization, and the failure of the last strike to 
halt job loss, many Mexican miners have lost their jobs and migrated 
north.  Two interviews record differing perspectives on that strike and 
its outcome. 
</p>

<p class="twc">
Not all Sonorans want to go north, however.  The Mayo communities of 
Navojoa maintain a set of cultural practices which are so strong that 
many Mayos, while they migrate as farm workers throughout northern 
Mexico, stay close enough to return for important celebrations like the 
Pascola.  Few migrate to the US, although over a century ago, Joaquin 
Murrieta himself, who may have been of Mayo ancestry, fought for the 
rights of Mexicans stranded in the US after the treaty of 1848.  A third
 section documents the Mayo Pascola and the experiences of a dancer and a
 teacher trying to preserve their culture.
