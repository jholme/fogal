<p class="twc">
Transnational working communities -- communities of working people that 
exist simultaneously on both sides of a border, or in more than one 
country at  the same time -- are not new.  In the context of the U.S. 
and Mexico, they are in part due to the migration of Mexicans north.  As
 the first step in exploring this social reality, Braceros and Border 
Crossers looks at the experience of migrating, of going north.  It is 
primarily an effort to see the experience historically, in terms of the 
personal memories of people who participated in the largest organized 
wave of migration, the bracero program, in which Mexicans were recruited
 to work as farm and railroad workers from 1941 to 1964.  Three 
interviews record that experience.  The fourth interview looks at it 
from the point of view of the child of a bracero family, who had the 
unique experience of growing up in both worlds, and who became committed
 to life as a partioipant in movements for social change as a result.  
The final article describes the experience of young people today as they
 wait just south of the border, looking for a chance to continue their 
journey north.

"Border Jumper" refers to the Mexican expression, brincar a la linea, or
 jump over the line, a way of describing the passage across the border.
